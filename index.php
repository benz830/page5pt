<br>In our situation today this pandemic, many people loses hope on having a good health.  Many people experiences stress because people find 
<br>it hard to find money but we should never lose hope to find ways because there are many ways to solve the problem.  To those who are grately 
<br>affected by the coronavirus pandemic I hope that this trials will not let us lose our hope and weaken us.  Let us make this pandemic strengthen
<br>our faith and hope to our God. And also never forget to seek help to our almighty God. So lets us be determined to be strong enough to face this
<br> pandemic. Let us in trust everything to God. Without our God there will no light in this darkest moments so let us keep our faith strong.

<br> Last year was a very rough one. We've been to many struggles and hardships. I'm pleased and amazed by those people who are struggling but still fighting
<br> because I know that it affects our day and mood when we have a problem and cannot think suitably, but that didn't stop them. We have to keep going because 
<br> life gave us this so that we can be strong and have the courage to keep moving. They were greatly affected by the pandemic but they didn't choose to give 
<br> up which symbolizes dove. It flies high, like if nothing is going on in their surroundings. They are focusing only on their destination.

 <br>For all those who are greatly affected by the pandemic, we hope that you will rise and fight this pandemic with the presence of God. We hope that you will 
 <br>not surrender while fighting this pandemic and stay safe in your home, and we hope that God will glorify you and give you many blessings after you were greatly 
 <br>affected by this pandemic. We make a design that is the dove that symbolizes peace to make our world peaceful after this pandemic makes the world chaotic. 
 <br>Because this pandemic ruins many people's lives that turn the world into chaos. And also many people were greatly affected because of this todayâ€™s pandemic. 
 <br>That's why we decided to draw a dove that represents peace to make people who got affected by this pandemic have peace and to prevent this world from chaos.

 <br>Since I can't really do much to those people who are affected deeply by this pandemic I just want to let you know that I'm praying for your guidance and protection.
<br> And I know we can pass this problem together. And don't lose hope because there are a lot of people who are kind enough to help. And the government are doing their
<br> best to overcome this pandemic that we are facing.
